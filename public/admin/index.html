      The Decap CMS script will automatically find and use the config.yml file
      in the same directory. We don't need to manually initialize it with a script tag
      if the config file is named config.yml and is in the same folder.
      
      However, if that doesn't work, we can be more explicit.
      Let's try the simplest approach first: just load the script and let it auto-discover.
