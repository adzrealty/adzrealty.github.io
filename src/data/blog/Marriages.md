# The Law of Marriage in the Philippines

An infographic journey through the Family Code, from the solemn vow of "I do" to the legal pathways of separation.

---

## 1. The Foundation of Marriage

### A "Special Contract" Protected by the State

The 1987 Constitution declares marriage an "inviolable social institution." The Family Code of 1987 modernized this, defining it as a permanent union between a man and a woman. It's not just a contract; its terms are governed by law, not by the parties, reflecting the state's profound interest in protecting the family.

### Key Statistical Change

**18** - The uniform minimum age for marriage under the Family Code, a significant increase from the Civil Code's 14 for females and 16 for males.

---

## 2. The Path to "I Do": Marriage Requisites

The Family Code creates a strict, two-tiered system for a valid marriage. Failing to meet these requirements has very different legal consequences.

### Essential Requisites ‚Üí Formal Requisites

#### 1. Essential Requisites
- **A) Legal Capacity:** A man and a woman, both at least 18 years old
- **B) Free Consent:** Given in the presence of the solemnizing officer

**Result if Absent:** Marriage is **VOID** from the start.

#### 2. Formal Requisites
- **A) Authority of Solemnizing Officer**
- **B) Valid Marriage License**
- **C) Marriage Ceremony** with two witnesses

**Result if Absent:** Marriage is **VOID** (with some exceptions).
**Result if only an Irregularity:** Marriage is **VALID**, but parties may be liable.

## 3. The Marital Bank Account: Property Regimes

The Family Code fundamentally changed the default financial relationship between spouses. Unless you sign a pre-nuptial agreement, your property regime is determined by your marriage date.

### Default Property Regimes by Marriage Date

#### Marriages ON or AFTER August 3, 1988
**Absolute Community of Property (ACP)**
- Think of it as a total merger
- Almost everything you both owned before and acquire during the marriage becomes one common fund
- **Composition:** ~90% Community Property, ~10% Exclusive Property (e.g., inheritance)
- **Division:** Entire net community divided 50/50

#### Marriages BEFORE August 3, 1988
**Conjugal Partnership of Gains (CPG)**
- This is a partnership model
- You each keep your own pre-marital property
- Only the "gains" or profits earned during the marriage are shared
- **Composition:** 40% Spouse 1 Separate Property, 40% Spouse 2 Separate Property, 20% Conjugal Gains
- **Division:** Only net gains divided 50/50

### Regime Comparison Summary

| Regime | Assets Included | Division Method |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Absolute Community (ACP)** | All pre-marital & acquired assets are pooled | Entire net community divided 50/50 |
| **Conjugal Partnership (CPG)** | Only fruits and income are pooled | Only net gains divided 50/50 |
| **Separation of Property** | No common fund. By agreement only | Each spouse keeps their own property |

## 4. A Union of Equals: Rights & Obligations

The Family Code promotes a partnership of equals, replacing old patriarchal rules with joint responsibilities.

### Core Spousal Obligations

1. **ü§ù Live Together** - The duty of cohabitation, forming a life together
2. **‚ù§Ô∏è Mutual Love, Respect & Fidelity** - The moral and emotional core, with legal consequences for infidelity
3. **ü´Ç Mutual Help & Support** - The duty of financial, emotional, and moral support

### Joint Decision-Making
Both spouses **JOINTLY** decide on the family home, manage the household, and are responsible for family support.

## 5. When the Vow Breaks: Legal Remedies

For irreparable marriages, Philippine law provides three distinct, non-divorce remedies. Understanding the difference is critical.

### Comparing Marital Remedies

| Remedy | Marriage Bond Severed? | Can Remarry? | Children Legitimate? |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Legal Separation** | No | No | Yes |
| **Annulment** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Declaration of Nullity** | Yes | Yes | Generally No (with exceptions) |

### Grounds for Annulment (Voidable Marriage)
*These grounds must exist at the time of the marriage:*

1. **Incurable Sexually Transmissible Disease**
2. **Physical Incapacity (Impotence)**
3. **Consent by Force or Intimidation**
4. **Consent by Fraud**
5. **Unsound Mind at time of marriage**
6. **Lack of Parental Consent (18-21)**

### Grounds for Nullity (Void Marriage)
*These marriages were invalid from the very beginning:*

- Under 18 years of age
- Bigamous or polygamous marriages
- Incestuous relationships
- Marriages against public policy (e.g., first cousins)
- No valid marriage license
- Solemnized by person without authority
- **Psychological Incapacity (Art. 36):** A party's inability to comprehend and assume essential marital obligations. Must be grave, pre-existing, and incurable.

## 6. The Complex Question of Divorce

The Philippines does not have a general divorce law. However, there are two significant, legally recognized exceptions.

### Exception 1: Divorce for Muslim Filipinos

Under **Presidential Decree 1083** (Code of Muslim Personal Laws), Muslim Filipinos can obtain a divorce through Shari'a Courts. This recognizes their unique religious and cultural practices.

- Applies to marriages between two Muslims
- Recognizes various types like Talaq (by husband) and Khul' (by wife)
- Divorce must be registered to be civilly recognized

### Exception 2: Recognition of Foreign Divorce

Under **Article 26(2) of the Family Code**, a Filipino married to a foreigner can have a foreign divorce recognized in the Philippines, allowing the Filipino spouse to remarry.

#### The Process:
1. **Foreign divorce is obtained abroad** (by either spouse)
2. **Filipino spouse files a Petition for Judicial Recognition** in a Philippine court
3. **Petitioner must prove** both the foreign divorce decree AND the foreign spouse's national law on divorce
4. **If successful,** the Filipino spouse is free to remarry

## 7. Prohibitions and Pathways to Remarriage

The law strictly forbids certain unions and criminalizes bigamy, requiring a final court order before one can remarry.

### Absolutely Prohibited Marriages

#### Incestuous (Void):
- Between ascendants and descendants (e.g., parent-child)
- Between brothers and sisters

#### Against Public Policy (Void):
- First cousins
- Step-parent and step-child
- Parent-in-law and child-in-law
- Adopter and adopted child

### The Danger of Bigamy

Contracting a second marriage while a prior one is still valid is the crime of bigamy. A person cannot simply assume their first marriage is void. **Article 40 of the Family Code requires a FINAL JUDICIAL DECREE** of nullity before remarrying. Without this court order, a second marriage leads to criminal liability.
